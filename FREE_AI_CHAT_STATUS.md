# Free AI Chat - Authentication Required

## Decision
Keep authentication required for Free AI Chat as requested.

## Current Configuration

### Endpoints
- **Path**: `/api/ai/chat/ollama/` 
- **Authentication**: Required (`IsAuthenticated`)
- **Model**: qwen2.5:latest
- **Ollama URL**: http://localhost:11434

### Why It's Called "Free"
The term "Free" in "Free AI Chat" refers to:
- ✅ **No cost** to use (no external API costs)
- ✅ **No document processing** (direct AI chat, no RAG)
- ✅ **No resource limits** for individual users
- ❌ **Still requires login** (authentication for security)

### Implementation Status
✅ All fixes applied:
1. Corrected Ollama URL to `http://localhost:11434`
2. Updated model to `qwen2.5:latest`
3. Added URL alias for frontend compatibility
4. Performance monitoring active

### User Flow
1. User must be logged in
2. Navigate to AI Assistant > Free AI Chat
3. Enter prompt
4. Get AI response without document search
5. Chat history saved to user account

### If Users Can't Access
Users need to:
1. Log in first at `/login`
2. Then access Free AI Chat

This is working as designed - authentication is a security feature, not a limitation of the "free" aspect.

## Summary
Free AI Chat works correctly but requires user authentication for security and history tracking purposes.
