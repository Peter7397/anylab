# Quick Fix Summary

## Problem
UI shows "No SSB Entries Found" even though 2,246 KPRs are in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. ✅ Data is imported: 2,246 KPR entries exist in database
2. ✅ Field mapping fixed: severity, platform fields corrected
3. ❌ Authentication issue: Frontend may not be authenticated

## What to Check

### In Browser Console
Check if there are authentication errors when loading the page:
```
Network tab → Look for /api/ai/documents/search/
Status 401 = Authentication issue
Status 200 = Data issue
```

### In Browser
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter for "search"
4. Look at the request/response for `/api/ai/documents/search/`
5. Check the response body - does it have `results` array?

## Quick Test
1. Refresh the page (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Make sure you're logged in
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Look at the Network tab to see what the API returns

## Expected Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Documents found",
  "data": {
    "results": [ ... 2246 documents ... ],
    "count": 2246
  }
}
```
