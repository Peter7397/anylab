**Status:** ✅ APPLIED
**Result:** All processing status fields added to database

---

## What Was Applied

### Database Changes:
- ✅ `processing_status` field added
- ✅ `metadata_extracted` field added
- ✅ `chunks_created` field added
- ✅ `embeddings_created` field added
- ✅ `processing_error` field added
- ✅ `processing_started_at` field added
- ✅ `processing_completed_at` field added
- ✅ `chunk_count` field added
- ✅ `embedding_count` field added
- ✅ Validation indexes added

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Automatic Processing

Upload a file to verify automatic processing works:

```bash
# The backend is already running or needs to be started
# When you upload a file through the UI, it will:
# 1. Create UploadedFile with status='pending'
# 2. Auto-trigger processing via signal
# 3. Extract metadata
# 4. Generate unlimited chunks
# 5. Create BGE-M3 embeddings
# 6. Mark as status='ready'
```

### 2. Monitor Processing

Check file status in database:

```sql
SELECT id, filename, processing_status, 
       metadata_extracted, chunks_created, embeddings_created,
       chunk_count, embedding_count
FROM ai_assistant_uploadedfile
ORDER BY uploaded_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. Test RAG Search

Once file shows `status='ready'`, test RAG search functionality.
