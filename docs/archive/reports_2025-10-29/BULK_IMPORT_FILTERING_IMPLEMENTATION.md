## 🎯 What Was Implemented

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### **Frontend: `frontend/src/components/AI/DocumentManager.tsx`**

#### 1. **Added File Type Filtering State** (Lines 120-122)
```typescript
// File type filtering state
const [enabledFileTypes, setEnabledFileTypes] = useState<Set<string>>(
  new Set(['pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'txt', 'xls', 'xlsx', 'ppt', 'pptx', 'html', 'mhtml'])
);
const [filteredOutFiles, setFilteredOutFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
```

#### 2. **Enhanced `handleFolderSelect` with Filtering** (Lines 628-687)
- Filters files based on enabled types
- Separates valid files from filtered-out files
- Shows clear feedback about filtered files
- Provides counts of included/excluded files

**Key Logic**:
- Checks file extensions against enabled document types
- Supports PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, TXT, RTF, MD, HTML, MHTML
- Re-filters when type selection changes

#### 3. **Added File Type Selection UI** (Lines 1608-1674)
- Interactive buttons for each file type
- Visual feedback (blue when enabled, gray when disabled)
- Icons for each type
- HTML/MHTML special handling
- Real-time re-filtering when types change

**UI Features**:
- Click to toggle file types on/off
- Grid layout for easy selection
- Shows "Only files with selected types will be included"
- Integrates with folder selection

#### 4. **Added Filtered Files Display** (Lines 1820-1849)
- Shows count of filtered-out files
- Lists each filtered file with reason
- Collapsible/hideable section
- Orange theme to distinguish from valid files

#### 5. **Updated Reset Logic** (Lines 1928-1929)
- Resets file type filter to defaults when modal closes
- Clears filtered files list
- Restores all enabled types to initial state

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Filtering Logic**:
```typescript
// For each file in selected folder:
1. Extract file extension (.pdf, .docx, etc.)
2. Check if extension matches enabled types
3. Check against documentTypes array
4. Include file if enabled, else add to filteredOut
```

### **Re-filtering on Type Change**:
```typescript
// When user toggles file type:
1. Update enabledFileTypes Set
2. Re-run filter on selectedFiles
3. Update display with new filtered list
4. Show updated counts
```

### **Filtering Process**:
1. **File Selection**: `handleFolderSelect` receives all files
2. **Type Check**: Check extension against enabled types
3. **Separation**: Valid files → selectedFiles, Others → filteredOutFiles
4. **Feedback**: Show counts and reasons
5. **Display**: List files with status indicators

## 📊 Example Usage

### **Scenario: Mixed Folder**:
```
Folder contents:
├── document1.pdf ✅ (enabled)
├── image1.jpg ❌ (filtered out)
├── spreadsheet.xlsx ✅ (enabled)
├── video.mp4 ❌ (filtered out)
├── readme.txt ✅ (enabled)
└── archive.zip ❌ (filtered out)

User only enables: PDF, Excel, Text

Result:
- 3 files ready to upload
- 3 files filtered out
- Clear feedback shown to user
```
