# MHTML Import Status Report

## Summary
The MHTML file at `/Users/pinggenchen/Downloads/M84xx.mhtml` contains **2,246 KPR entries** across **1,600+ keyword sections**. The current parser is extracting only **34-35 entries** (1.5% success rate).

## What's Working ✅
1. MIME decoding (Quoted-Printable) - Working
2. HTML extraction from MHTML boundaries - Working  
3. KPR number detection (2,246 found) - Working
4. Keyword detection (1,600+ found) - Working
5. File upload UI - Working
6. Backend API endpoint - Working

## Root Cause ❌

### The Problem:
The file has **multiple KPR entries per keyword section**, but the current parser only captures **1 KPR per keyword** because:
- Keyword sections are repeated (same keyword appears many times)
- Each keyword section has multiple KPR# entries
- Current regex pattern `(?=KPR#:|Keyword:|$)` stops at the first KPR# occurrence

### Example Structure:
```
Keyword: 68xx Driver
KPR#:147 6890N with 7693 barcode scanning...
KPR#:148 Customer can't install column...
KPR#:150 Setting a Hold time...

Keyword: 68xx Driver  (SAME KEYWORD REPEATED!)
KPR#:156 Some other issue...
KPR#:157 Another issue...

[etc - keyword appears 60+ times with different KPRs each time]
```

## Statistics
- **Total KPR entries in file:** 2,246
- **Currently extracting:** 34-35 (1.5%)
- **Keywords found:** 1,600+
- **Unique keywords:** ~50
- **Pattern:** Keywords repeat with different KPR subsets

## Recommended Solution

The current parser implementation in `kpr_index_parser.py` needs to:
1. Process all KPRs in each keyword section (not just first one)
2. Handle repeated keywords by merging or appending
3. Extract full descriptions (not truncated)

The regex pattern needs modification to capture **all KPR entries between keywords**, not just the first one.

## Current Status
- Frontend import button: ✅ Ready
- Backend endpoint: ✅ Ready  
- MHTML support: ✅ Working
- MIME decoding: ✅ Working
- Full KPR extraction: ❌ Needs fix

## Next Steps
1. Update `_extract_kprs_by_keyword()` method to capture all KPRs in a section
2. Test with M84xx.mhtml file
3. Verify all 2,246 entries are imported
4. Re-test import functionality
