# What's Happening - Status Explanation

## Current Situation

### Backend Status:
✅ **Backend is UP and running** (process 49890)
✅ **Health check passing**: http://localhost:8000/api/health/ returns healthy
✅ **API endpoints responding**

### The Problem:
❌ **SSB cards showing "Product:..." instead of actual titles**

### Root Cause Analysis:

Looking at the actual MHTML file, the structure is:
```
HTML structure: <a href="...">KPR#147</a> [description text here]
```

The parser extracts text like:
```
"</a> 6890N with 7693 barcode scanning checksum mismatch..."
```

But when storing in database, it's getting **wrong information** because:
1. The extracted text has HTML remnants (`</a>`)
2. The database shows "Product:68xx Driver Software 6890 6.25" 
3. This suggests the extracted text is including product metadata, not the actual problem description

### What's Actually Happening:

The database has OLD data from the previous import (before we fixed the title extraction).

You need to:
1. **Clear the database** (remove existing SSB_KPR entries)
2. **Re-import** the MHTML file with the FIXED parser

## Solution:

Since the backend is up:
1. Go to SSB Database UI
2. The import WILL work
3. But the titles will STILL show "Product:" because the parser needs a fix

The parser is extracting the wrong part of the text. It's capturing product info instead of problem descriptions.

## Next Steps:
1. Fix parser to extract actual problem descriptions
2. Clear database  
3. Re-import with fixed parser
4. Titles will show correctly
