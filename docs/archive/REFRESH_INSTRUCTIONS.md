# Refresh Instructions

## Backend Status
âœ… Backend is RESTARTED and running (process 25940)
- All code changes are loaded
- Parser improvements are active
- Ready to import SSB files

## Frontend - You Have 2 Options:

### Option 1: Hard Refresh in Browser (FASTEST)
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/ai/knowledge/ssb`
2. Press **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows)
3. This forces browser to reload all JavaScript
4. You'll see the new list view with clean titles

### Option 2: Restart Frontend Server
If hard refresh doesn't work:
```bash
# Stop the frontend (Ctrl+C in terminal where it's running)
# Then restart:
cd frontend
npm start
```

## What You Should See After Refresh:

1. **Default View = List** (not cards anymore)
2. **Product Tabs** at the top with counts
3. **Clean Titles** without "Product:" prefix
4. **List items** showing: KPR number + Full description title

## Next Step:
Import your SSB file using the "Import SSB File" button!
