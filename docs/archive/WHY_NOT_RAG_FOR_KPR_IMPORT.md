# Why Not Use RAG for KPR Import?

## Problem Statement
The MHTML file contains structured KPR (Known Problem Report) data in a predictable format:
- Keywords followed by KPR entries
- Each KPR has a number and description
- Format: `KPR#:123 Description text...`

## Why RAG is NOT Suitable Here

### 1. **Overkill for Structured Data**
- The data is already structured (not free-form text)
- No need for semantic understanding
- Simple pattern matching is sufficient

### 2. **Performance**
- **Regex parsing**: ~1 second for 2,246 entries
- **RAG with LLM**: ~10-30 seconds per entry = **6+ hours total**
- 10,000x slower!

### 3. **Cost**
- LLM API calls for 2,246 entries would be expensive
- Regex parsing is free and local

### 4. **Accuracy**
- Pattern matching: 100% accurate for structured format
- RAG could hallucinate or misinterpret entries

### 5. **Reliability**
- Regex works consistently every time
- LLM responses can vary

## What RAG IS Good For
- **Unstructured documents** (PDFs, emails)
- **Semantic search** across imported KPRs
- **Question answering** about imported KPRs
- **Content classification** when rules are complex

## Recommended Approach
✅ Use regex to **import** structured KPR data (fast, accurate)  
✅ Use RAG to **search and query** the imported KPRs (semantic understanding)

## Summary
For importing 2,246 structured KPR entries: **Regex parsing**  
For searching and understanding imported KPRs: **RAG**
