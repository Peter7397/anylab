# RAG Accuracy Optimization Plan
**Goal:** Maximum Accuracy, Zero Hallucination - Speed Unimportant

---

## Current State Analysis

### Your Priority:
‚úÖ **Accuracy** - Most important  
‚ö†Ô∏è Speed - Not a concern  
‚úÖ **Strict adherence to documents** - Critical  

### Current RAG Strengths for Accuracy:
- ‚úÖ Query-type specific generation parameters
- ‚úÖ Hybrid search (BM25 + Vector) for better retrieval
- ‚úÖ Cross-encoder reranking for relevance
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive mode retrieves 15 results from 40 candidates
- ‚úÖ Large context window (12,000 chars)

### Current Potential Issues:
‚ö†Ô∏è Temperature (0.1-0.15) might still allow some creativity  
‚ö†Ô∏è LLM might still use external knowledge if prompt isn't strict enough  
‚ö†Ô∏è No explicit "don't hallucinate" warnings in prompt  
‚ö†Ô∏è Similarity threshold (0.4) might miss relevant documents  

---

## Optimization Strategy for Maximum Accuracy

### Phase 1: Make LLM Strictly Document-Only (Highest Impact)

#### Current Prompt Issues:
```python
# Current Comprehensive Prompt (from comprehensive_rag_service.py lines 107-121)
comprehensive_instruction = (
    "You are an expert technical consultant providing comprehensive, detailed responses.\n\n"
    "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPREHENSIVE ANSWERS:\n"
    "1. Use ALL available information from the provided context - leave nothing out\n"
    "2. Provide COMPLETE, DETAILED answers regardless of length\n"
    "3. Include ALL relevant details, steps, procedures, and explanations\n"
    "4. Synthesize information from ALL sources to create a thorough response\n"
    "5. Cite sources using [Source: filename] format\n"
    "6. If multiple sources provide similar information, combine and elaborate\n"
    "7. Include specific details like version numbers, file paths, exact procedures\n"
    "8. Provide background context and explanations for better understanding\n"
    "9. Never truncate or summarize - give complete, exhaustive information\n"
    "10. Structure the response logically using clear paragraphs and natural flow\n"
    "11. Do NOT use markdown formatting, headers (###, ####), or special symbols\n"
    "12. Write in plain text with proper paragraph breaks and natural organization\n\n"
)
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Doesn't explicitly forbid external knowledge
- ‚ùå No strong anti-hallucination warnings
- ‚ùå Doesn't emphasize "ONLY use provided context"

#### Optimized Prompt for Maximum Accuracy:

```python
# NEW: Maximum Accuracy Prompt
STRICT_ACCURACY_PROMPT = """
You are a technical documentation expert. Your ONLY source of information is the provided context below.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - READ THESE CAREFULLY:

üö´ FORBIDDEN ACTIVITIES:
1. DO NOT use any knowledge outside the provided context
2. DO NOT guess, infer, or make assumptions
3. DO NOT use common sense or general knowledge
4. DO NOT fill in gaps with external information
5. DO NOT extrapolate beyond what is explicitly stated
6. DO NOT create examples that aren't in the documents
7. DO NOT add details that aren't explicitly mentioned
8. DO NOT use technical terms you learned elsewhere

‚úÖ REQUIRED BEHAVIORS:
1. Extract information EXACTLY as stated in the context
2. ONLY cite information that appears in the provided context
3. If information is missing in the context, state: "This information is not available in the provided documentation"
4. Quote directly from the context when possible
5. Include page numbers and source names for every claim
6. If multiple sources conflict, present both perspectives
7. Use precise technical terms exactly as they appear in documents
8. Include all steps/procedures in the exact order they appear

ACCURACY CHECKS BEFORE RESPONDING:
- Can I point to the exact sentence in the context that supports this claim? YES/NO
- Am I adding any information not in the context? YES/NO (must be NO)
- Are all my facts directly from the documents? YES/NO (must be YES)

Citation Format:
For each claim, cite as: [Source: filename, Page X, Paragraph Y]

{context_here}

Question: {query}

Response (use ONLY the context above, do not use any external knowledge):
"""
```

**Why This Works:**
- üéØ Explicit "FORBIDDEN" section prevents guessing
- üéØ Accuracy checks before responding
- üéØ Mandatory citations for every claim
- üéØ Clear directive to not use external knowledge

---

### Phase 2: Optimize LLM Generation Parameters for Maximum Precision

#### Current Parameters (Comprehensive RAG):
```python
'procedural': {
    'num_predict': 3000,
    'temperature': 0.1,     # ‚ö†Ô∏è Might still allow some creativity
    'top_p': 0.8,
    'repeat_penalty': 1.15
}
```

#### Optimized Parameters for Accuracy:

```python
# ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE Parameters for Maximum Accuracy
ACCURACY_OPTIMIZED_PARAMS = {
    'procedural': {
        'num_predict': 4000,        # Allow long, complete responses
        'temperature': 0.05,        # ‚¨áÔ∏è VERY LOW (almost deterministic)
        'top_p': 0.7,              # ‚¨áÔ∏è More focused sampling
        'repeat_penalty': 1.3,      # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Prevent repetition that might indicate guessing
        'num_ctx': 8192,
        'top_k': 20                # ‚¨áÔ∏è Smaller token pool (more conservative)
    },
    'definitional': {
        'num_predict': 3000,
        'temperature': 0.05,       # ‚¨áÔ∏è Very low
        'top_p': 0.75,
        'repeat_penalty': 1.25,
        'num_ctx': 8192
    },
    'troubleshooting': {
        'num_predict': 4000,
        'temperature': 0.05,       # ‚¨áÔ∏è Critical for accuracy
        'top_p': 0.7,
        'repeat_penalty': 1.3,
        'num_ctx': 8192
    },
    'general': {
        'num_predict': 3500,
        'temperature': 0.05,       # ‚¨áÔ∏è Lowest possible
        'top_p': 0.8,
        'repeat_penalty': 1.2,
        'num_ctx': 8192
    }
}

# Key Changes:
# Temperature: 0.1-0.15 ‚Üí 0.05 (much more deterministic)
# Top_p: 0.8-0.9 ‚Üí 0.7-0.8 (narrower distribution)
# Repeat_penalty: 1.1-1.25 ‚Üí 1.2-1.3 (less repetitive tokens)
# Top_k: 40 ‚Üí 20 (fewer token options)
```

**Impact:**
- **Temperature 0.05** ‚Üí Almost deterministic, minimal creativity
- **Top_p 0.7** ‚Üí Only considers most likely tokens
- **Higher repeat_penalty** ‚Üí Prevents LLM from repeating itself (which can be a sign of guessing)
- **Lower top_k** ‚Üí Fewer token choices = more conservative

---

### Phase 3: Retrieve More Documents (Cast Wider Net)

#### Current Settings:
```python
# Comprehensive RAG
comprehensive_candidates = 40
similarity_threshold = 0.4     # Might miss some relevant docs
final_results = 15
```

#### Optimized for Maximum Recall:

```python
# MAXIMUM RECALL Settings
ACCURACY_OPTIMIZED_RETRIEVAL = {
    'candidates_to_retrieve': 60,      # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 50% more (was 40)
    'similarity_threshold': 0.3,       # ‚¨áÔ∏è More inclusive (was 0.4)
    'final_results': 20,              # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 33% more (was 15)
    'hybrid_results': 40,             # More for reranking
    
    # Ensure we don't miss relevant documents
    'min_documents_per_source': 1,    # At least 1 from each relevant source
    'diversity_bonus': 0.1            # Boost documents from different sources
}

# Rationale:
# - More candidates = better chance of finding all relevant info
# - Lower threshold = don't miss marginally relevant docs
# - More results = more complete context for LLM
```

---

### Phase 4: Enhanced Prompt with Verification Steps

```python
# Two-Stage Verification Prompt
VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_PROMPT = """
Step 1: INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM CONTEXT ONLY
----------------------------------------
Extract relevant information from the provided context. For each piece of information:

1. Identify the SOURCE (filename and page)
2. Quote the EXACT TEXT from the document
3. Mark any information you cannot find in the context as "NOT IN CONTEXT"

Context:
{context}

Step 2: RESPONSE GENERATION (VERIFICATION FIRST)
-------------------------------------------
Before writing your response, verify each claim by checking:

‚úì Is this information directly stated in the context?
‚úì Can I provide the exact source and page number?
‚úì Am I adding ANY information not in the context?

If you cannot verify a claim in the context, use: "This information is not available in the provided documentation."

Question: {query}

Provide a complete, detailed answer using ONLY verified information from the context above.
Include source citations for every claim.
"""
```

---

### Phase 5: Post-Response Verification (Optional but Recommended)

```python
# Add Verification Layer After LLM Generation
def verify_response_accuracy(response: str, context_docs: List[Dict], query: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Verify that every claim in the response has support in the context
    """
    verification_result = {
        'response': response,
        'claims': [],
        'all_verified': True,
        'suspicious_claims': []
    }
    
    # Split response into claims
    claims = extract_claims_from_response(response)
    
    for claim in claims:
        # Check if claim has citation
        has_citation = check_citation_present(claim)
        
        # Check if cited source exists in context
        source_exists = verify_citation_in_context(claim, context_docs)
        
        if not has_citation:
            verification_result['suspicious_claims'].append(claim)
            verification_result['all_verified'] = False
        
        verification_result['claims'].append({
            'claim': claim,
            'has_citation': has_citation,
            'source_exists': source_exists
        })
    
    # If verification fails, generate warning
    if not verification_result['all_verified']:
        verification_result['response'] += "\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Some information could not be verified in the provided documentation."
    
    return verification_result
```

---

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Create the AccuracyOptimizedRAGService** with all these improvements?
2. **Update the existing ComprehensiveRAGService** with just the prompt and parameter changes?
3. **Provide the code changes** for you to implement?

I recommend option 2 for quick results, then option 1 for maximum accuracy.
