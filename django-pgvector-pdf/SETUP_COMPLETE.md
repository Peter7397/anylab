## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
   - You'll be redirected to the login page

2. **Upload PDF Documents**:
   - Use the web interface to upload PDF files
   - The system will extract text and create embeddings

3. **Test Vector Search**:
   - Search through your uploaded documents
   - Use semantic similarity to find relevant content

4. **Integrate with Qwen**:
   - The Django app can now communicate with Ollama
   - Use the qwen2:latest model for AI responses

## 📊 System Resources

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Embeddings**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (mounted locally)
- **AI Models**: qwen2:latest (7.6B parameters, Q4_0 quantization)
- **Web Server**: Gunicorn with 4 workers
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx for production deployment
