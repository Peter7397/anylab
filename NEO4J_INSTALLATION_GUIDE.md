# Neo4j Installation Guide for Graph RAG Migration

## üê≥ Docker vs Localhost Installation

### Recommendation: **Use Docker** (Strongly Recommended)

For Option 1 (Hybrid Vector + Graph RAG), **Docker is the better choice** for the following reasons:

### Docker Installation - Pros ‚úÖ

1. **Isolation & Clean Environment**
   - No conflicts with existing system software
   - Doesn't modify your system configuration
   - Easy to clean up if needed

2. **Portability**
   - Same setup works across development, staging, production
   - Easy to replicate on different machines
   - Version control friendly (Docker Compose in git)

3. **Easy Management**
   - Start/stop with simple commands
   - No manual service configuration
   - Pre-configured with sensible defaults

4. **Integration with Existing Stack**
   - Your project already uses Docker (backend services)
   - Can add to existing `docker-compose.yml`
   - Consistent with your current infrastructure

5. **Simplified Updates**
   - Update by pulling new image
   - No need to uninstall/reinstall
   - Version pinning for stability

6. **Resource Control**
   - Easy memory/CPU limits
   - Better resource monitoring
   - Can run multiple versions side-by-side

### Localhost Installation - Cons ‚ùå

1. **System Dependencies**
   - Requires Java 11+ installation
   - May conflict with other Java applications
   - OS-specific installation steps

2. **Manual Configuration**
   - Need to configure Neo4j service
   - Firewall rules, ports, paths
   - More complex for team setup

3. **Harder to Reproduce**
   - Different setups across team members
   - Environment-specific issues
   - Harder to share/replicate

4. **Cleanup Complexity**
   - Manual removal if needed
   - May leave system modifications

### Performance Comparison

**Docker**: ~95-98% of native performance (negligible difference for your use case)
**Localhost**: 100% native performance

**Verdict**: The small performance difference doesn't justify the added complexity for your project.

## üîå Django Integration

### Install Python Driver

```bash
pip install neo4j
```

### Django Settings

Add to `settings.py`:

```python
# Neo4j Configuration
NEO4J_URI = os.getenv('NEO4J_URI', 'bolt://localhost:7687')
NEO4J_USER = os.getenv('NEO4J_USER', 'neo4j')
NEO4J_PASSWORD = os.getenv('NEO4J_PASSWORD', 'your_password_here')

# Neo4j Connection (will be created in service)
```

### Connection Service

Create `backend/ai_assistant/services/neo4j_service.py`:

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
import os
from django.conf import settings

class Neo4jService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
            settings.NEO4J_URI,
            auth=(settings.NEO4J_USER, settings.NEO4J_PASSWORD)
        )
    
    def close(self):
        self.driver.close()
    
    def execute_query(self, query, parameters=None):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            result = session.run(query, parameters or {})
            return [record.data() for record in result]
    
    def test_connection(self):
        try:
            with self.driver.session() as session:
                result = session.run("RETURN 1 AS test")
                return result.single()["test"] == 1
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Neo4j connection error: {e}")
            return False

# Global instance
neo4j_service = Neo4jService()
```
