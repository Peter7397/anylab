Laboratory Protocol: DNA Extraction and Analysis

1. INTRODUCTION
This protocol describes the standard procedure for DNA extraction from biological samples and subsequent analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.

2. MATERIALS REQUIRED
- Sample tubes containing biological material
- DNA extraction kit (Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit)
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5ml and 2ml)
- Pipettes (10μl, 100μl, 1000μl)
- Centrifuge
- Water bath or heating block
- Ethanol (70% and 100%)
- Distilled water
- Buffer solutions (ATL, AL, AW1, AW2, AE)

3. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
- Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Work in a biosafety cabinet for potentially infectious samples
- Dispose of biological waste according to institutional guidelines
- Follow standard laboratory safety protocols

4. PROCEDURE

4.1 Sample Preparation
- Label all tubes clearly with sample identification
- Ensure samples are properly stored at appropriate temperatures
- Record sample information in laboratory notebook

4.2 DNA Extraction
1. Add 200μl of sample to 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube
2. Add 20μl of proteinase K and 200μl of buffer AL
3. Mix thoroughly by vortexing for 15 seconds
4. Incubate at 56°C for 10 minutes
5. Add 200μl of ethanol (100%) and mix by inverting
6. Transfer mixture to DNeasy Mini spin column
7. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute
8. Discard flow-through and add 500μl buffer AW1
9. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute
10. Discard flow-through and add 500μl buffer AW2
11. Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 3 minutes
12. Transfer column to new 1.5ml tube
13. Add 200μl buffer AE and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute
14. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute to elute DNA

4.3 DNA Quantification
- Measure DNA concentration using spectrophotometer
- Calculate DNA yield and purity (A260/A280 ratio)
- Record results in laboratory notebook

4.4 Quality Control
- Run gel electrophoresis to verify DNA integrity
- Check for contamination using negative controls
- Document all quality control results

5. TROUBLESHOOTING

Common Issues:
- Low DNA yield: Check sample quality and extraction efficiency
- Poor DNA quality: Verify buffer conditions and incubation times
- Contamination: Review sterile technique and equipment cleaning

6. EXPECTED RESULTS
- DNA concentration: 50-200 ng/μl
- A260/A280 ratio: 1.8-2.0
- DNA integrity: Clear bands on agarose gel
