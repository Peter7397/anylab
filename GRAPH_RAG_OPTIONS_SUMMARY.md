# Graph RAG Migration Options - Quick Summary

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

### Choose Option 1 (Hybrid) if:
- ✅ You want the best balance of features and effort
- ✅ You need to keep existing system running
- ✅ You have 4-6 weeks for implementation
- ✅ You want to minimize risk
- ✅ **Recommended for most cases**

### Choose Option 2 (Full Graph) if:
- ✅ You want a complete graph solution
- ✅ You have 6-8 weeks for implementation
- ✅ You're okay with larger migration effort
- ✅ You want single source of truth

### Choose Option 3 (Lightweight) if:
- ✅ You need something quick (2-3 weeks)
- ✅ You want minimal infrastructure changes
- ✅ You're okay with limited graph capabilities
- ✅ Budget is very tight

### Choose Option 4 (Incremental) if:

## 🚀 Recommended: Option 1 - Hybrid Vector + Graph RAG

### Why This Is Best

1. **Proven Architecture**: Industry standard approach
2. **Minimal Risk**: Existing system continues working
3. **Best Performance**: Combines semantic search + structured knowledge
4. **Scalable**: Can grow as needed
5. **Reasonable Timeline**: 4-6 weeks is achievable

### What You Get

- ✅ Vector similarity search (existing functionality)
- ✅ Graph-based entity relationships
- ✅ Better query understanding
- ✅ More accurate responses
- ✅ Relationship-aware context

### Investment Required

- **Time**: 4-6 weeks
- **Cost**: $8,000-$12,000 development
- **Infrastructure**: Neo4j Community (free) or Cloud ($50-200/month)
