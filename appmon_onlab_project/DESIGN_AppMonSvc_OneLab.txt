Application Monitoring Service (AppMonSvc) — OneLab Enhanced (v2.0.0)

Scope
-----
Tail-focused log watcher with regex-based detection, context capture and artifact-free, low-overhead alerting. Integrates with OneLab via /alerts/ and /metrics/ endpoints. Adds deduplication, metrics, performance tracking, configuration validation, and structured logging.

High‑Priority Features
----------------------
1) Enhanced Alert Schema: adds context lines, fingerprint, app category, file metadata, alert_id, metadata bundle.
2) Deduplication: TTL‑based in-memory cache with bounded size; fingerprint = sha256(app|pattern|normalized_line).
3) Metrics Upload: periodic (default 60s) POST to /metrics/ with service, performance, cache and application stats.

Medium‑Priority Features
------------------------
4) Structured Logging & Scan Summaries.
5) Configuration Validator with actionable errors/warnings.
6) Performance Tracker using psutil to sample CPU/MEM along the way.

Config
------
- config/global.default.json: defaults incl. paths, dedup, alert_server base, OneLab mappings.
- config/appmon.onlab.json: site overrides.
- sources[].patterns[]: name, regex, severity, context_before/after.
