   - **Best for:** Direct similarity matching
   - **Speed:** 300-600ms
   - **Use when:** Exact semantic matching needed

---

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Similarity Threshold Optimization

**Current Settings:**
- Improved/Advanced: `0.5` (medium strictness)
- Comprehensive: `0.4` (looser)

**Recommendation:** 
- **0.6-0.7** for high-precision (fewer false positives)
- **0.3-0.4** for high-recall (more results, may include noise)
- **Current 0.5** is balanced

**Action:** Monitor result quality. Adjust based on:
- False positive rate (irrelevant results)
- False negative rate (missed relevant results)

---

### 2. Top-K Candidates Optimization

**Current Settings:**
- Improved: 20 candidates → 8 results
- Advanced: 30 candidates → 8 results
- Comprehensive: 40 candidates → 15 results

**Analysis:**
- **Retrieve Ratio:** ~2.5x to 3x
- More candidates = better final results, but slower

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Current (Conservative)
top_k_candidates = 20, 30, 40
final_top_k = 8, 8, 15

# Suggested for Better Quality
top_k_candidates = 24, 36, 50  # +20% more candidates
final_top_k = 10, 10, 20       # More diverse results

# For Speed Optimization
top_k_candidates = 15, 25, 35  # -20% fewer candidates
final_top_k = 6, 6, 12         # Focused results
```

---

### 3. Cache Duration Optimization

**Current Settings:**
```python
Embedding Cache:  1h (Enhanced) vs 24h (Improved) ❌ Inconsistent
Search Cache:    1h (Advanced/Comprehensive)
Response Cache:  30m (All)

Comprehensive:   2h (search results) ⚡
```

**Issues:**
- Inconsistent embedding cache across services
- Search and response cache mismatch

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Standardized Cache Strategy
embedding_cache_ttl = 86400       # 24h (consistent across all)
search_cache_ttl = 7200            # 2h (search results)
response_cache_ttl = 3600          # 1h (final responses)

# Rationale:
# - Embeddings don't change frequently → 24h OK
# - Search results change with new documents → 2h
# - Responses adapt to context → 1h
```

---

### 4. Hybrid Search Configuration

**Current:** Enabled in Advanced+ with 2x top_k for reranking

**Parameters:**
```python
vector_candidates = 30
hybrid_results = top_k * 2  # 16 for advanced, 30 for comprehensive
final_results = top_k       # 8 or 15
```

**Analysis:**
- Retrieving 30 → 16 → 8 is **3.75x reduction**
- This is **efficient** for reranking

**Recommendation:**
- Keep current pipeline
- Consider **dynamic top_k based on query complexity**
  - Simple queries: skip reranking (faster)
  - Complex queries: full pipeline (better results)

---

### 5. Query Expansion Optimization

**Current:** Always enabled in Advanced+ 

**Problem:** Some queries don't benefit from expansion (very specific, short queries)

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Intelligent Query Expansion
def should_expand_query(query: str) -> bool:
    """Only expand if query might benefit"""
    
    # Don't expand very specific queries
    if len(query.split()) > 8:
        return False  # Already specific
    
    # Don't expand very short queries
    if len(query.split()) < 3:
        return True   # Need expansion
    
    # Don't expand queries with exact phrases (quotes)
    if '"' in query:
        return False
    
    # Expand for general queries
    return True

# Usage
expanded_query = query_processor.expand_query(query) if should_expand_query(query) else query
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster for specific queries
- Better results for general queries
- Adaptive performance

---

### 6. Context Length Optimization

**Current:**
- Comprehensive: `max_context_length = 12000`

**Analysis:**
- Very long context for LLMs
- May hit token limits or slow down responses

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Dynamic Context Length
def get_optimal_context_length(query_type: str, results_count: int) -> int:
    """Calculate optimal context based on query and results"""
    
    base_length = 4000  # Minimum for good results
    
    if query_type == 'research':
        return 12000  # Maximum detail
    elif query_type == 'definitional':
        return 6000   # Concise but informative
    elif results_count > 10:
        return 8000   # Multiple sources
    else:
        return 4000   # Standard
        
# Example
context_length = get_optimal_context_length(query_type, len(results))
```

---

### 7. Performance Monitoring

**Metrics to Track:**

```python
# Recommended Metrics
rag_metrics = {
    'search_time_ms': 0,         # Total search time
    'embedding_time_ms': 0,      # Embedding generation
    'vector_search_ms': 0,       # Vector search time
    'hybrid_search_ms': 0,       # Hybrid time
    'reranking_ms': 0,           # Reranking time
    'results_count': 0,          # Results returned
    'cache_hit': False,          # Cache hit rate
    'similarity_scores': [],     # Relevance scores
    'query_type': '',            # Query classification
    'tokens_used': 0             # LLM tokens
}

# Target Performance
target_speeds = {
    'basic': 500,      # ms
    'improved': 800,   # ms
    'advanced': 1500, # ms
    'comprehensive': 2500  # ms
}
```
