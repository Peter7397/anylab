# Backend Status Report

## Current Status: ❌ NOT RUNNING

### Issues Found:
1. ❌ Django backend server is not running
2. ❌ Port 8000 has no listener
3. ✅ Virtual environment exists and Django is installed
4. ⚠️  Frontend on port 3000 is running (blocking hybrid startup)

### Diagnostic Results:
- No Django runserver process running
- No process listening on port 8000
- Health check fails: Connection refused
- PID file exists but process is dead

### Database Status:
- Need to check if PostgreSQL is running
- Need to check if Redis is running

## What Happened:

The hybrid startup script failed because frontend is already running on port 3000. This prevents the automated startup from working.

## Solution:

### Option 1: Start Backend Only (Recommended)
Since frontend is already running on port 3000, we should start the backend separately:

```bash
cd /Volumes/Orico/OnLab0812/backend
source venv/bin/activate

# Check database connection
python manage.py check

# Start database if needed
# (Check Docker for PostgreSQL and Redis)

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Start Django server
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Option 2: Use Existing Setup
If database is already running via Docker:

```bash
cd /Volumes/Orico/OnLab0812/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
